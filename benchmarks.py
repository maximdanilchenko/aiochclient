"""
This module is used for testing speed of aiochclient after
any changes in its code. It is useful for comparing its
results with older versions speed. Results mostly depends
on the part which makes serialize and deserialize work.

Pay attention to that fact, that this benchmark is just one
task (all queries go one by one) without async staff.
So you can get much more speed from parallelling all those
IO with asyncio instruments.
